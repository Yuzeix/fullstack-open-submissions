# Full Stack Open - Part 0, Exercise 0.1  

This directory contains the solution for Exercise 0.1 of Part 0 of the Full Stack Open course.  

**Exercise 0.1: Basic HTML**  
The goal of this exercise was to become familiar with the basic structure of an HTML document. It involved creating a simple HTML file with essential elements such as `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, `<body>`, and text elements like headings and paragraphs.  

**Personal Reinforcement Project: website-jumbo-fake**  
Within this same directory, the `website-jumbo-fake` folder contains an additional personal project. This project serves as reinforcement practice to consolidate the HTML concepts learned in Exercise 0.1 by creating a simple HTML structure that mimics the foundation of a supermarket website.
