# Full Stack Open - Part 0, Exercise 0.2  

This directory contains the solution for Exercise 0.2 of Part 0 of the Full Stack Open course.  

**Exercise 0.2: Basic CSS**  
The goal of this exercise was to introduce the basic concepts of CSS and how to apply styles to an HTML document. The lesson covered creating CSS rules to select HTML elements and apply styling properties.  

**Personal Reinforcement Project: website-jumbo-fake-2**  
Within this same directory, the `website-jumbo-fake-2` folder contains an additional personal project. This project builds upon the HTML created in the reinforcement of Exercise 0.1 (`website-jumbo-fake`) and applies CSS styles using the concepts learned in Exercise 0.2. It serves as reinforcement practice for applying CSS to an existing HTML structure.
